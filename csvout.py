# Description:
# This script identifies sub-directories in the current directory that contain specific files 
# and then converts all `.txt` files in these sub-directories to `.csv` format. The specific criteria for 
# sub-directory selection are:
# 1. Contains at least one file that starts with "ACA".
# 2. Contains at least one file that starts with "sun".
# 3. Contains one or more files that start with numerical digits.
# 
# For the conversion:
# 1. Remove any existing commas from each line.
# 2. For files with "ACA" or "sun" in their names, remove colons between variable names and numerical values.
# 3. Remove leading and trailing whitespaces from each line.
# 4. Split the line by spaces to identify individual items.
# 5. Write the items to a new `.csv` file using commas as separators.
# 
# Requirements provided by Dr. Douglas Buettner.
